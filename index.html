            <p>Boiling eggs is an art form, and the right timing can make all the difference. Explore the different types of boiled eggs, their ideal cooking times, and how to use them in your dishes.</p>

                <div class="egg-type">
                    <h4>Dippy Eggs for Soldiers (3 Minutes) ü•ö</h4>
                    <p>Perfect for dipping toast sticks (soldiers) into a runny yolk. The outer whites are just set, while the inner whites and yolk remain runny, ideal for mixing and dipping.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Best For:</strong> Dipping with buttery toast soldiers, a playful breakfast treat.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Use a small spoon to scoop out the runny center if you don‚Äôt have toast sticks.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="egg-type">
                    <h4>Runny Yolks (6 Minutes) ü•ö</h4>
                    <p>These eggs have a barely set white, making them delicate to peel. The yolk is runny, offering a creamy texture but requiring careful handling.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Best For:</strong> Caesar salad, avocado toast, or as a topping for grain bowls.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tip:</strong> If peeling is too difficult, consider poached or sunny-side-up eggs for similar yolk consistency with easier handling.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="egg-type">
                    <h4>Soft Boiled Eggs ‚≠êÔ∏è (8 Minutes) ü•ö</h4>
                    <p>The perfect balance! The yolk is just set, offering a creamy texture without being runny. The whites are fully cooked but still tender.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Best For:</strong> Salads (Nicoise, chicken pasta salad, Gado Gado), fish pie, or classic egg sandwiches.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Slice in half and let the creamy yolk act as a natural dressing for your salad.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="egg-type">
                    <h4>Hard Boiled Eggs (10 Minutes) ü•ö</h4>
                    <p>Fully cooked yolks and whites, but still tender. A great alternative to soft-boiled eggs if you prefer a firmer texture.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Best For:</strong> Devilled eggs, egg salad, or as a protein-packed snack.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Add a pinch of baking soda to the boiling water to make peeling easier.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="egg-type">
                    <h4>Overcooked Eggs (12 Minutes+) ü•ö</h4>
                    <p>Powdery yolks and rubbery whites with the dreaded grey ring around the yolk. Not recommended, but to each their own!</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Best For:</strong> Not much! Maybe for egg art if you‚Äôre feeling creative.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Avoid overcooking by using the Eggquisite Timer to stop at the perfect time.</li>

            <h3>Step-by-Step Guide to Boiling Eggs</h3>
            <p>Follow these steps to achieve the perfect boiled egg every time:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Start with Room Temperature Eggs:</strong> Take your eggs out of the fridge 20-30 minutes before boiling to prevent cracking.</li>
                <li><strong>Boil Water:</strong> Bring a pot of water to a rolling boil. Add a pinch of salt to help with peeling.</li>
                <li><strong>Gently Add Eggs:</strong> Use a spoon to lower the eggs into the boiling water to avoid cracking.</li>
                <li><strong>Set the Timer:</strong> Use the Eggquisite Timer to set the exact time for your desired doneness (3, 6, 8, or 10 minutes).</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare an Ice Bath:</strong> While the eggs cook, fill a bowl with ice water to stop the cooking process immediately after boiling.</li>
                <li><strong>Cool the Eggs:</strong> Once the timer goes off, transfer the eggs to the ice bath for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Peel and Enjoy:</strong> Gently tap the eggs on a hard surface to crack the shell, then peel under running water for easier removal.</li>
            </ol>

                <h4>Pro Tips for Perfect Eggs</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Freshness Matters:</strong> Fresher eggs are harder to peel. Use eggs that are 7-10 days old for best results.</li>
                    <li><strong>Altitude Adjustment:</strong> If you‚Äôre at a high altitude, you may need to add 30-60 seconds to the cooking time due to lower boiling temperatures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Store boiled eggs in the fridge for up to a week. Keep them in their shells until ready to eat to maintain freshness.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flavor Boost:</strong> Add a splash of vinegar or soy sauce to the boiling water for a subtle flavor infusion.</li>
                    <li><strong>Perfect Peeling:</strong> Roll the egg gently on the counter to create small cracks all over before peeling‚Äîthis makes the shell come off more easily.</li>
                </ul>
